### 📝 Notes & Reflections
- **What went well:**
	- Changed the process into getting the raw Capital Market data and Storing it in a Table in PostGress.
	- Cleaning the raw data and making a table solely for Symbol Names
- **Challenges:**
	- Speed of transactions 
- **Next steps:**
	- Taking every symbol and getting their data from 2000 to 2024.
	- Storing each of them in a new table of the symbol each, in the database called Stock Data.
