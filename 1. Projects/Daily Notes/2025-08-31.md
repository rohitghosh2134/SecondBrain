### 📝 Notes & Reflections
- **What went well:**
	- Installed PostgresSQL to store Stock Data
	- Downloaded the NSE Eq market given by FYERS
- **Challenges:** 
	- The link is stored in a ENV file which cannot be uploaded to git , so need to store in a safe place.
- **Next steps:**
	- Clean the file to store only the symbol names
	- Get the values from each symbol from the year 2000 to 2024
	- Store them in the psql database.
