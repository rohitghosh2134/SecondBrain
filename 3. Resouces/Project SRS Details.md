### **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**

#### **1. Introduction**

- **1.1 Purpose:** Define the purpose of this documentâ€”to specify all requirements for the Stock Market Prediction App.
- **1.2 Document Conventions:** Describe any formatting or naming conventions used.
- **1.3 Project Scope:** Provide a high-level overview of the app. What is it? Who is it for? What problem does it solve?
- **1.4 References:** List any related documents, such as initial project proposals or research papers.

#### **2. Overall Description**

- **2.1 Product Perspective:** How does this app fit into the broader context of stock market tools? Is it a standalone app or part of a larger system?
- **2.2 Product Functions:** Summarize the major functions the app will perform (e.g., data fetching, model prediction, data visualization).
- **2.3 User Classes and Characteristics:** Describe the target users (e.g., beginner investors, data science students, personal use).
- **2.4 Constraints:** List any limitations, such as using a specific technology stack (Python, MongoDB), a fixed deadline, or a limited budget (e.g., using a free-tier database).
    
#### **3. Functional Requirements**

This section is the core of the document, detailing what the system **must** do.

- **3.1 Data Ingestion:**
    - The app must be able to fetch historical stock data for a given ticker.
    - The app must update data daily to ensure it is current.
    - The system must store data in a non-relational database.
    
- **3.2 Machine Learning Model:**
    - The system must train a time-series prediction model (e.g., LSTM) on historical data.
    - The model must be able to predict future closing prices for a specified number of days (e.g., 7 days).
    - The model's accuracy must be evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
        
- **3.3 Backend API:**
    - The API must provide an endpoint to retrieve historical data for a ticker.
    - The API must provide an endpoint to return a stock price prediction.
    - The API must handle requests with invalid ticker symbols gracefully.
        
- **3.4 User Interface (UI):**
    - The app must have a user-friendly dashboard to display stock information.
    - The UI must include a search bar for users to input a stock ticker.
    - The UI must display a chart of historical and predicted prices.
    - The UI must show a simple, clear output of the final predicted price.
    
#### **4. External Interface Requirements**

- **4.1 User Interface:** Specify the design guidelines, screen layouts, and any UI components to be used.
- **4.2 Hardware Interfaces:** Describe minimum hardware requirements for running the app.
- **4.3 Software Interfaces:** Detail how the app will interact with external APIs (e.g., `yfinance`) and databases (MongoDB).

#### **5. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **5.1 Performance:**
    - The prediction endpoint must respond in under 500ms for a single request.
    - The app must be able to handle at least 10 concurrent users.
    
- **5.2 Security:**
    - The app must protect against common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    - The MongoDB connection string must be stored securely.
    
- **5.3 Reliability:**
    - The app's data ingestion process must be resilient to API failures.
    - In the event of an error, the app must display a user-friendly error message.
    
- **5.4 Maintainability:**
    - The code must be well-commented and organized into logical modules.
    - The app should be easy to update with a new model version.
